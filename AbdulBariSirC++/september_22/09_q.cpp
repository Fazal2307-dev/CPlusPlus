// 2
// 2 liters of water to cool for one hour.

// How much water (in liters) would be required by the cooler to cool for 
// N
// N hours?

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain an integer 
// T
// T â€” the number of test cases. The description of 
// T
// T test cases follows.
// The first and only line of each test case contains an integer 
// N
// N, as described in the problem statement.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output the number of liters of water required by the water cooler to cool for 
// N
// N hours.
